CoinEase is a beginner-friendly app built on Shido Network that makes it easy for new users to get started in the crypto space. Users can log in to their wallet with social accounts, recover funds accidentally sent to the wrong recipient, pay anyone on Shido Network with a QR code, and buy or sell cryptocurrency without needing to trust a third party.
